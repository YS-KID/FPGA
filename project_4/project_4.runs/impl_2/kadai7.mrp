  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.

  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static

using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
